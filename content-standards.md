1. Products

  a. Opus1 Gouging Machine - An oboe cane gouger
  
  Alternate: After referenced at least once in an article, "gouger" or "gouging machine" may be used as shorthand substitute
  
  Note: "Gouger" is the machine that gouges cane, whereas a "gouge" is the actual or intended curve/measurements of a piece of cane after it has been gouged
  
  b. Fillotine - A two-in-one guillotine and fillier
      
      1. Fillotine - the main body of the machine
      
      2. Pusher - long plastic rod with wooden grip
      
  c. Multi-Tool - An accessory used for taking control of cane selection and inspecting gouging results
      
      1. Gouge Point Location Finder - points located 1.0 mm apart on a curved endpoint used to mark a piece of cane for further measurement with a micrometer
     
      2. Radius Gauges - curved insets at 1/4 mm increments between 10 mm and 11 mm used for identifying the tube of cane's radius 
    
      3. Ruler with Engraved Reed - used for taking measurements during the reedmaking process
      
  d. Opus1 Travel Case - Travel case filled with Kaizen Foam
  
----------------------------------
  
2. Opus1 Gouging Machine Components
  
  a. bed - the front, bottom section of the machine where the piece of cane rests
  
  b. guide - the curved metal in front of the blade
 
  c. blade - what cuts/bores out the cane
  
  d. rod - back rod via which the gouger moves back and forth
  
  e. spring - provides tension for the clips to hold cane in the bed
 
  f. clips - holds the cane in the bed
  
  g. adjustment screws
    
----------------------------------

3. Standard Measurments

Note: These are guideposts and every reedmaker will prefer different measurements. The strength of the Opus1 Gouging Machine is that it allows for adjustment of different thicknesses with just one screw each.

  a. Finished reed length: 70mm
  
  Note: The engraved reed in the Multi-Tool is based on a reed of John Mack which actually measured 69mm. The proportions, however, are the same as that of a 70mm reed as it concerns the relationship between the "tip," the "heart," and the "back" of the reed.
  
  b. "Ideal" radius for a piece of cane: 10.5mm
  
  Note: the higher the radius, the smaller the opening of a reed will be made with that cane.
  
  c. Thickness at the center of a gouged piece of cane: 6.0mm (usually referenced as 60 micrometers)
  
  d. Thickness at the sides of a gouged piece of cane: 5.0mm (usually referenced as 50 micrometers)
  
  e. Width of a piece of cane prepared by the Fillotine ready for gouging: 8mm
